## Next Assignment 1

This project is a next.js web application using  
a functional component to display content on the page.  
I ran 'npx create-next-app@latest next-project-1' in the  
parent directory git bash terminal where I wanted my project to be.  
I created my \about directory and created my short bio component as a page.js file inside.
I imported that component into my webpage page.js file and placed  
it in my rfc return statement.
Then synced changes to GitHub.
